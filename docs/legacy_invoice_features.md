# Legacy Invoice Features

The following features were specific to the project's original invoice focus and have been removed from the core platform:

- Flagged invoices and related fraud endpoints
- Recurring billing templates and automated payment retries
- Purchase order matching and dedicated PO upload APIs
- Stripe payment links and webhooks
- Budget warnings, forecasts, and over-budget analytics
- Categories such as "Marketing", "Legal", and "Recurring"
- Cash flow simulations and scenario planning
- Vendor reply email drafts and payment request forms

These capabilities are archived here for historical reference and may serve as guidance if invoice-centric workflows are revisited.
