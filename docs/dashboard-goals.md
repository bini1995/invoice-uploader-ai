# AI Dashboard Strategic Goals

This document outlines the high level objectives for the "AI Dashboard" screen. The dashboard should immediately provide insight and encourage further use of the product, even when there is no data available.

## Goals

- **Summarize performance and issues at a glance.**
- **Prompt action where needed** &mdash; for example, highlighting flagged invoices.
- **Give a snapshot of AI activity and health.**
- **Encourage product exploration** with suggested next steps.
- **Look good even with zero data** by using helpful empty states and informative placeholders.
