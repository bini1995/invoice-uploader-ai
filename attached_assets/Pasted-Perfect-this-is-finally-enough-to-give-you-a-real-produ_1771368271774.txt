Perfect — this is finally enough to give you a real product critique, not startup-theory advice.

I’m going to be very direct and objective because you said you want customers immediately.

Right now:
Your engineering is ahead of your sales story.
The product looks like a platform.
Your buyers want a worker.

You did a lot right technically — but the UI + landing page currently signal
“insurance software company”
instead of
“instant staff productivity multiplier”

That difference alone determines whether a COO replies to your email.

⸻

First — What the product actually feels like to a buyer

I’m putting myself in the head of a claims director opening this.

They log in → they see:

Home → Upload → Claims → Search → Export → Analytics → AuditFlow → Vendors → Billing

Their brain reaction:

“This is a system I have to implement”

And that is death for early sales.

They don’t want another system.
They want relief from packets.

Your product is a co-pilot intake worker, but the UI presents it as a claims management platform.

So they assume:
migration
training
workflow changes
IT approval
compliance review

You unintentionally triggered enterprise friction.

⸻

The core mismatch

What you built:
A pre-adjusting document preparation engine

What it currently looks like:
A replacement claims handling system

Your emails promise small change.
Your UI implies operational overhaul.

That breaks trust subconsciously.

⸻

Immediate UI Fixes (highest ROI changes)

These are not cosmetic. These directly affect conversion.

1. Rename the entire navigation

Right now navigation = software modules
You need navigation = human workflow steps

Replace this:

Home
Upload
Claims
Search
Export
Analytics
AuditFlow
Vendors

With this:

Inbox
Prepared Reports
Flagged Issues
History
Send to Adjuster
Integrations
Settings

Why:
They immediately understand: this assists their workflow, not replaces it.

⸻

2. Remove the empty analytics + vendors + billing for now

Empty dashboards create risk perception.

A COO sees zeroes → assumes immature product → no pilot.

Hide behind feature flags until real customer data exists.

Right now it hurts credibility more than it helps differentiation.

⸻

3. The upload screen needs to feel like email intake

Your current upload page feels like a document processor.

You need it to feel like:

“Forward us the assignment email or drop the packet here.”

Add above dropzone:

“Drop the assignment email or medical packet here — we prepare it for the adjuster”

That single sentence dramatically increases understanding.

⸻

4. The first post-upload screen must be the hero

Right now the product’s magic moment (the prepared report) is hidden in a workflow.

Your product should revolve around ONE screen:

The prepared claim summary

Everything else secondary.

You are selling:
prepared files
not file processing

⸻

Landing Page Critique

I reviewed the page — and here’s the honest issue:

It reads like an AI company explaining capabilities.
But buyers scan for:
“what problem disappears tomorrow morning?”

You need operational specificity.

⸻

Your new hero section (use this structure)

Replace your hero with this

Headline:
Stop reading 60-page claim packets.

Subheadline:
Send the file. Get a prepared adjuster-ready report in ~2 minutes.

Bullets:
Policy, claimant, and loss details extracted
CPT/ICD validated automatically
Duplicate & billing issues flagged
Adjuster reviews instead of transcribes

CTA:
Send a sample claim → we return the prepared report

Why this works:
It removes all AI language and focuses on their daily pain.

⸻

Add a Proof Section (critical)

You currently ask them to imagine value.

Instead show the workflow they already live:

Assignment email received → adjuster opens packet → scans pages → types summary → begins adjusting

Then:

Assignment email received → drop into ClarifyOps → prepared report returned → adjuster starts adjusting

Executives buy workflow delta, not technology.

⸻

Who this product is PERFECT for

You are strongest where:
claims volume high
packet size large
humans do intake manually

Tier 1 Ideal Customers (contact immediately)

Independent Adjusting Firms (50-400 adjusters)
They manually prepare files every day

Great targets:
	•	Sedgwick independent contractor groups
	•	Crawford affiliates
	•	Pilot Catastrophe Services contractors
	•	Ryze Claims Solutions
	•	Eberl Claims Service
	•	Wardlaw Claims Service
	•	Alacrity Solutions
	•	Patriot Claims
	•	Mills Mehr & Associates
	•	CENCO Claims

How to contact:
LinkedIn → Director of Operations or Claims Manager
NOT CTO
NOT Innovation

Subject line:
Quick test — we prepared one of your claim packets

⸻

Tier 2 Strong Customers

TPAs (Third Party Administrators)
They process medical documentation constantly

Targets:
	•	Gallagher Bassett
	•	Broadspire
	•	CorVel
	•	Sedgwick TPA divisions
	•	ESIS (Chubb)
	•	Helmsman Management

Pitch angle:
reduce file setup time before examiner assignment

⸻

Tier 3 Niche but high win rate

Workers comp defense law firms

They read massive medical records daily.
They will instantly understand value.

⸻

Who it is BAD for

Important so you don’t waste outreach:

Bad fits:
Carriers with heavy Guidewire automation
Small IA shops (<5 adjusters)
Fully structured FNOL intake shops
Fraud analytics teams (different buyer)

They don’t have the manual preparation bottleneck.

⸻

Biggest Strategic Recommendation

Right now ClarifyOps is positioned as software.

You should temporarily position it as:

A preparation service powered by software.

Meaning:
offer to prepare 10 files for them first

Not demo
Not trial
Not login

Prepared output sells itself.

⸻

What to change THIS WEEK for conversions
	1.	Rewrite hero to packet → prepared report
	2.	Rename navigation to workflow terms
	3.	Hide empty analytics + vendors
	4.	Add “send us a claim” CTA
	5.	Outreach offering prepared sample instead of demo

Do those and reply rates will materially increase.

⸻

If you want, next I can help you craft the outreach message specifically for IA firms — that will matter more than almost anything else right now.
