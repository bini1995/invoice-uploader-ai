Perfect — this is the part that actually matters.

We are not going to “market a SaaS”.

We are going to sell labor replacement using software as the delivery mechanism.

Right now you’ve built a platform.
But your first customers should experience it as a service.

That single shift dramatically increases reply rates.

⸻

The goal

Within 14 days:
you get 1–2 paying customers ($200–$800/mo)

Not pilots
Not feedback calls
Actual money

⸻

The positioning change (critical)

Stop saying:

AI claims platform

Start saying:

We prepare claim packets before your adjuster opens them

You are selling time returned to employees.

⸻

Your ICP (very specific)

Do NOT target carriers
Do NOT target insurtech startups
Do NOT target hospitals

Target ONLY:

Independent Adjusting Firms (5–50 adjusters)

Why:
They feel pain daily and can decide instantly.

⸻

What you will sell first

Not subscriptions.

You sell:

Per-claim processing

Example offer:

“We’ll prepare your first 25 claims free. After that it’s $3–$6 per claim depending on volume.”

That is easier to buy than $499/mo software.

Monthly pricing comes later.

⸻

The 14 Day Execution Plan

Day 1 — Fix your homepage (takes 1 hour)

Your hero should say this:

Headline:
Your adjusters shouldn’t spend 45 minutes reading every claim file

Sub:
Forward the assignment email — we prepare the claim summary, codes, and timeline before they open it.

Button:
Send us a sample claim

Remove all platform language above the fold.

⸻

Day 2 — Create your “offer message”

You will use ONE outreach message everywhere.

Use this:

Hi — quick question.

When a new claim assignment comes in, how long does your team spend reading documents and typing details into the system before they can actually start adjusting?

We built a tool that prepares the claim file for them first (summary, codes, payments, timeline).

We’re offering to process 25 claims free so you can measure the time saved before deciding anything.

If it doesn’t help, no worries.

Would you be open to trying it with a few old files?

No demo link.
No pitch deck.
No features.

⸻

Day 3–5 — Build a lead list (this is the real work)

You need 80–120 firms.

Where to find them:

Google search:
independent adjusting firm + state

Examples:
independent adjusting firm florida
property damage adjusters texas
insurance adjusters california IA firm

Open each site → find email

You want emails like:
assignments@
claims@
admin@
info@

Not just CEOs.

Put in a spreadsheet:
company | email | state

You should get ~20 per hour.

⸻

Day 6–10 — Send outreach (high volume, low friction)

Send 20–30 emails per day manually.

No automation yet.
Manual gets higher replies.

Do NOT customize heavily.
Speed matters more than personalization.

⸻

What happens when someone replies

You DO NOT sell.

You respond:

Perfect — you can send 2–3 old claim packets here:

claims@clarifyops.com

We’ll prepare them and send back a sample so you can see the difference.

You are now providing value before asking for commitment.

⸻

After you send results

You send this:

Out of curiosity — how long would this normally take your adjuster?

(wait for answer)

Then:

If this saves you real time, we typically charge per processed claim so it scales with your workload.

Would you like us to continue handling incoming claims for a week so you can measure it?

Now you are transitioning into revenue.

⸻

Expected conversion math

100 emails →
15 replies →
6 send files →
3 impressed →
1–2 paying

This is normal.

⸻

Why this works

You are not asking them to:

learn software
change workflow
integrate systems
train staff

You are inserting into existing behavior:
they already receive claim emails

You simply sit in the middle.

⸻

Very important mindset shift

Right now you built:

a product looking for users

You need:

a service that becomes a product

Most successful workflow startups start exactly this way.

⸻

Your weekly revenue goal (realistic)

Week 2: $300–$800 MRR
Week 4: $1.5k–$3k MRR
Then you productize

⸻

If you want next, I’ll help you craft the “after they send files” response so it converts into payment naturally instead of feeling like a pitch.
