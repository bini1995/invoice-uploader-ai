This update is a huge improvement — now the product finally communicates a workflow instead of a dashboard.

You basically moved from:
admin console → guided tool

That alone will increase successful pilots.

But you’re now at the stage where small UX decisions will determine whether someone says:

“cool demo”
or
“I need this”

Below is a brutally honest product + landing page review.

⸻

PART 1 — In-App UX Audit (what a real adjuster experiences)

I’m going to simulate a first-time pilot user.

They clicked your email.
They logged in.
They want to test ONE claim.

⸻

1) Home Screen — Much Better, Still Missing Urgency

You now show:

Upload → Review → Export

Good. This removes confusion.

But psychologically it still feels like instructions, not value.

Problem

You describe actions before showing proof.

Users trust visual output more than steps.

Fix (very important)

Under the “Upload a claim file” card, add a real preview snippet:

“Here’s what a prepared file looks like”

Even a blurred example dramatically increases uploads.

Right now they must believe you.
You want them to see you.

⸻

2) Upload Screen — Very Strong

This is your strongest screen now.

Good signals:
	•	no integration required
	•	export after review
	•	private data

You removed the biggest adoption fear.

One improvement

Add one line:

“Typical processing time: ~20–40 seconds”

People hesitate less when they know they won’t wait forever.

⸻

3) Claims List Page — Still a Friction Point

Current experience:
Upload → land on a blank management table

Emotion:
“Did it work?”

You unintentionally reintroduced enterprise-software anxiety.

What should happen instead

After upload completes → automatically open the prepared claim

Never send them to a list.

Lists are for power users.
Pilots need a moment of payoff.

⸻

4) Search Page — Hide During Pilot

This is powerful later but confusing early.

A first-time user thinks:
“Am I supposed to index all my claims here?”

That triggers adoption resistance.

Recommendation:
Hide Search until ≥ 3 claims processed

⸻

5) Export / Delivery / Webhooks

Great for future customers.
Bad for first-impression.

These screens communicate:
system integration platform

Your current goal:
pre-processing assistant

Keep them — but visually de-emphasize until after first success.

⸻

6) Review Queue

This will be strong once populated.

Right now empty tables weaken trust.
Empty tables = unfinished product in users’ minds.

Add placeholder:

“No files need review yet — upload a claim to generate a prepared report”

⸻

The Biggest Missing Moment (Critical)

Your product still lacks a WOW screen.

You have the engine.
You don’t have the reveal.

After upload, the user should see:

Prepared Claim File

Summary
Key Details
Flags
Ready for review

Not a table.
Not metadata.
Not navigation.

A document replacement.

That single screen determines conversion.

⸻

PART 2 — Landing Page Audit (after seeing product)

Now that I understand the real workflow, the homepage needs one adjustment:

Right now your site explains a capability.
Your app demonstrates a shortcut.

Your site should promise the shortcut.

⸻

What the landing page should emphasize

Not:
AI processes claims

But:
Your adjuster starts halfway through the job

Because that is literally what the product does.

⸻

Required landing page changes

Hero should reference time loss moment

Instead of conceptual messaging, anchor to the moment:

“When a claim packet arrives, your adjuster shouldn’t start from scratch.”

This matches exactly what they experience in the app.

⸻

Add visual proof section

Before features, show:

Original packet → Prepared file

This aligns expectations with the UI.

⸻

Change primary CTA

Right now (likely):
Book demo

Should be:
Send us one anonymized claim — we’ll prepare it

This matches your actual best onboarding path.

⸻

What Will Happen After These Changes

Today:
Users explore → think → maybe reply later

After adjustments:
Users upload → see replacement work → ask pricing

That is the transition from interesting software to operational tool.

⸻

Final Honest Assessment

You don’t have a product gap anymore.

You have a reveal gap.

The system works like a prep assistant
but still introduces itself like a platform

Once the first processed claim is shown as the center of the experience,
your pilots will convert at a much higher rate.

⸻

If you want next, I’ll design the exact “prepared claim report” layout (what should appear immediately after upload) — that screen matters more than any other part of the product right now.
