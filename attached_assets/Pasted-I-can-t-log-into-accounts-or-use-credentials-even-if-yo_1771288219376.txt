I can’t log into accounts or use credentials — even if you provided them — and I won’t attempt to access a private system.
But we can still do a full audit accurately: just send screenshots (or a screen recording) of the logged-in pages you want reviewed, and I’ll analyze them exactly the same way a prospect would experience them.

What I can audit right now is the public landing page (what cold prospects see before deciding to contact you).
And that’s actually the most important part for getting customers immediately.

Landing Page Audit (Objective, buyer-psychology focused)

I’m reviewing this as:
• an adjuster
• an operations manager
• a skeptical COO who got your email

The only question in their head:
“Do I understand in 5 seconds why this helps me today?”

⸻

1. First Impression (0–5 seconds)

Current perception:

“This is an AI insurance product… but I’m not yet sure where it fits in my workflow.”

This means:
they think
→ interesting
but not
→ urgent

You need urgent.

What’s missing

A concrete moment.

Right now the page describes a capability.
It should describe a moment in their day.

⸻

Fix

Your hero must anchor to an inbox moment.

Replace conceptual wording with situational wording.

Example:

Instead of
AI claims processing / extraction language

Use
When a 60-page claim packet arrives, your adjuster shouldn’t start from scratch.

That line alone increases replies because they instantly visualize pain.

⸻

2. The “What is this replacing?” Fear

Every ops person subconsciously scans for risk signals.

Signals that scare them:
platform
workflow system
analytics suite
fraud detection engine

Those imply:
migration effort
training
stakeholder approval

Even if unintentional, parts of the page still hint at:
“another system”

You want:
assistant, not replacement

⸻

Fix

Add a very visible reassurance block near the top:

Works alongside your existing claim system
No integration required
Export results or send automatically when ready

This reduces cognitive load immediately.

⸻

3. Features Appear Before Outcome

Right now the page explains functionality before payoff.

Humans don’t buy capabilities.
They buy “what changes tomorrow morning”.

You need a BEFORE / AFTER section early.

⸻

What converts better

Before ClarifyOps
Open each attachment
Pull details manually
Write initial summary
Then start adjusting

After ClarifyOps
Open prepared file
Review
Decide

This is the highest-conversion element for ops tools.

⸻

4. CTA Friction

If the main CTA is demo-style (schedule call, learn more, etc.), early prospects hesitate.

Early stage buyers respond much more to:
test it on real work

Add this CTA

Send us one anonymized claim file — we’ll process it

This works because:
low commitment
immediate value
no meeting required

⸻

5. Who It’s For (Important filter)

You should explicitly name:

Independent adjusting firms
Legal medical record review teams
Claims service providers

Do NOT emphasize carriers yet.
They reduce reply rate (people assume enterprise sales cycle).

⸻

Overall Landing Page Score

Clarity to engineer: high
Clarity to operator: medium
Urgency: low-medium
Trust: good
Conversion friction: moderate

You are close — now it’s wording psychology, not product.

⸻

What I need to audit the logged-in app

Upload screenshots (or short video) of:
	1.	Upload a claim → what user sees immediately after
	2.	A processed claim view
	3.	Chronology / summary output
	4.	Duplicate detection comparison
	5.	Export/report output

I’ll then tell you:
• who will instantly trust it
• who will hesitate
• what to tweak for pilots to succeed

That will directly impact whether your outreach turns into real users.
