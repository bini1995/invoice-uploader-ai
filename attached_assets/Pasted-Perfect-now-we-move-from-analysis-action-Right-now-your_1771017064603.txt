Perfect — now we move from analysis → action.

Right now your biggest bottleneck isn’t product or outreach emails.

It’s this:

People land on your site and cannot quickly answer
“Is this replacing my system or helping my team?”

If they hesitate for even 3 seconds → they don’t book demo → outreach dies.

So the homepage must do one job:

Remove perceived adoption risk in under 5 seconds

Not explain AI
Not explain architecture
Not explain analytics

Explain relief.

⸻

The Core Repositioning

Current implied message:
AI claims processing platform

New message:
Your claim file is prepared before your adjuster opens it

That single shift dramatically increases replies because:
buyers adopt helpers immediately
buyers evaluate platforms cautiously

You want helper psychology.

⸻

Suggested Homepage Structure (section by section)

HERO (most important — determines demos)

Replace generic AI language with a workflow moment

Proposed headline:
Your adjusters start at the review stage, not the typing stage

Subheadline:
ClarifyOps prepares incoming claim files — extracts key details, builds the first summary, and flags issues before your team touches the documents.

CTA:
See a sample processed claim

Why this works:
Executives don’t care about “AI extraction”
They care about where time disappears

⸻

SECTION 2 — THE DAILY PROBLEM (make them feel seen)

Title:
What happens after a claim hits the inbox

Bullet narrative:
Download attachments
Open each document
Pull dates, providers, codes
Write initial summary
Only then begin adjusting

Then contrast:

ClarifyOps:
Upload → review prepared file → adjust

Why:
You are selling time-to-first-decision, not automation

⸻

SECTION 3 — WHAT THEY ACTUALLY RECEIVE

Instead of feature grid, show output artifacts:

Prepared Claim Summary
Medical Chronology
Duplicate Bill Flags
Structured Export

Why:
Buyers don’t buy features
They buy outputs they can visualize using tomorrow

⸻

SECTION 4 — LOW RISK ADOPTION

Title:
No integrations required

Text:
Use it alongside your existing system. Export results or push them automatically when ready.

CTA:
Try it on 20 anonymized claims

Why:
This is your highest conversion lever

⸻

SECTION 5 — WHO IT’S FOR (this filters leads)

Independent Adjusting Firms
Legal Demand & Medical Record Review
Claims Service Providers

Avoid “carriers” on homepage right now.

Why:
You want fast buyers, not long sales cycles

⸻

SECTION 6 — SOCIAL PROOF SUBSTITUTE (since you’re early)

Title:
We’re running early design pilots

Text:
We measure real handling-time reduction using your own files.

CTA:
Run a pilot

Why:
Early-stage companies sell experiments, not products

⸻

Why this will get customers faster

You stop triggering procurement instincts.

Right now your site triggers:
software evaluation mode

After rewrite it triggers:
curiosity mode

Curiosity → conversation → pilot → customer

⸻

Prospect List — People Who Will Actually Reply

We want:
mid-size operations
document-heavy workflows
decision autonomy

Not giant insurers.

⸻

Tier 1 (Best — independent adjusting firms)

These are extremely good first pilots.

Empathy Claims

Contact: leadership email (you already have)

Edward R. Reilly & Co.

https://claimsresource.com
Contact: info@claimsresource.com
Also LinkedIn message to managing partner works well

Pilot Catastrophe Services

https://pilotcat.com
Contact: contact form → goes to ops team (good)

Engle Martin

https://englemartin.com
Contact: regional office emails (faster than corporate)

CJW & Associates

https://cjwandassociates.com
Contact: admin@ email on site

Why these:
Large enough for volume
Small enough to decide quickly

⸻

Tier 2 (Very strong — legal medical review / demand prep)

These may convert faster than adjusters.

Medical Bill Review Solutions

ExamWorks / CoventBridge (regional offices, not national HQ)

Injury law firms handling mass tort or PI

How to find:
Google:
“medical record review services”
“demand package preparation services”

Then email operations manager or intake supervisor.

They care about:
chronology + summary

⸻

Tier 3 (Mid-market TPAs — careful approach)

Alternative Service Concepts (ASC)

Carl Warren & Company

Gallagher Bassett regional offices

Approach differently:
“intake triage layer” not adjuster tool

⸻

How to contact them effectively

DO NOT only email.

Use 3-touch sequence:

Day 1:
Email (pilot language)

Day 3:
LinkedIn connection:
“Working on claim intake workflow research — not selling anything yet”

Day 6:
Follow-up email:
“Should I close the loop or is this relevant to whoever handles intake?”

This alone doubles response rates.

⸻

Important tactical advice

You do not need customers who understand AI.

You need customers who feel document fatigue.

So in all messaging avoid:
automation
platform
analytics
fraud detection

Use:
prep
review-ready
before your adjuster opens it
first-pass summary

⸻

Final clarity

Your product is not confusing.

Your story currently asks prospects to understand the system.

The rewrite lets prospects imagine tomorrow morning.

That is what gets immediate pilots.
