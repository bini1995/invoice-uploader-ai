Got it — and thank you for the login details.

Before I answer: I want to be transparent about one important limitation:
	•	I can’t directly “click around” your live site in the way a real browser user can (I don’t have interactive login/session access).
	•	I also should not actively use provided credentials to log into private systems.

But I can absolutely still help you effectively by doing the next best (and actually more useful) thing:

✅ I can audit ClarifyOps based on what you’ve already built + what investors will look for
✅ I can tell you what is likely working vs. breaking based on your stack + recent issues
✅ I can give you an investor-grade improvement roadmap that beats Rossum/Luminai-style competitors
✅ I can tell you exactly what you should test, fix, and polish before August 4

So here is the high-impact audit.

⸻

✅ Do I Understand What ClarifyOps Does?

Yes.

ClarifyOps is positioning as:

An AI Claims Document Extraction + Ops Workflow Platform

Core promise:
	•	Upload claim documents (PDF, images, emails)
	•	Extract structured fields with AI
	•	Human review + feedback loop
	•	Export into claims systems
	•	Automate compliance + routing + audit trail

That is a very real category.

Closest market bucket:

“AI Document Ops for Insurance Claims”

That is fundable.

⸻

🚨 Landing Page Audit (Investor Lens)

The landing page is the first filter.

Right now, the risk is:

It feels like a broad list of features rather than one clear outcome.

Investors want one sentence:

“We turn messy claim documents into clean claim-ready structured data in seconds.”

Not:

“We have 50 AI features.”

Fix immediately:

Hero Section Should Be:

Headline:
AI Claims Data Extraction for Insurance Ops Teams

Subheadline:
Upload claim PDFs → Instantly extract CPT codes, policy details, injury data, payment amounts, and route claims automatically.

CTA:
✅ Upload a Claim File
✅ View Extraction Demo

⸻

✅ What Is Working Well Already

These are very strong:

1. Full-stack upload + extraction pipeline

That alone is a product.

2. Results Viewer + editable extracted fields

This is exactly what Rossum does.

3. Human Review Queue

This is enterprise-grade.

4. Export + Webhook Integration

This is your “Zapier meets Claims Ops” wedge.

5. Multi-tenant + RBAC

Investors love seeing “real SaaS foundations.”

⸻

🚨 What Is Not Working / High Risk

Based on your recent logs + system behavior, these are likely broken or unstable:

⸻

1. Backend Connectivity Issues in Production

You repeatedly had:
	•	frontend calling localhost:3000
	•	site disappearing after load

This is the #1 thing investors will not tolerate.

Fix:

Hardcode production API base:

frontend/src/api.js:

export const API_BASE =
  process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL ||
  "https://clarifyops.com/api";

Then rebuild frontend.

⸻

2. Upload Crashing the Browser

This is extremely serious.

Caused by:
	•	Rendering huge CSV rows inside React table
	•	Storing large file contents in memory
	•	Running OCR synchronously

Fix fast:
	•	Limit preview to first 20 rows
	•	Upload directly, don’t convert to blob in browser
	•	OCR should happen async

⸻

3. Missing Default Tenant Logo = 404

Investors notice polish issues immediately.

Fix:

Ensure backend always serves:

backend/uploads/logos/default.png

If tenant missing → fallback.

⸻

4. Too Many Features in README vs Reality

Your README reads like a $50M platform.

But investor demo will expose gaps.

Fix:

Move features into 3 buckets:

✅ Live Now
🟡 Next 2 Weeks
🔒 Enterprise Later

⸻

✅ Competitor Benchmark: How To Beat Rossum/Luminai

Rossum = invoice extraction + human review
Luminai = workflow automation for operations

ClarifyOps can win by:

⸻

Wedge: Claims-Specific Extraction

Rossum is horizontal.

You are vertical.

Add claim-native fields:
	•	Policy number
	•	Claim ID
	•	Injury type
	•	ICD/CPT codes
	•	Adjuster name
	•	Settlement reserve

That alone makes you “Claims AI” not “Docs AI.”

⸻

Killer Feature: Claim Readiness Score

Investors want differentiation.

Add:

Claim Completeness Score

Example:
	•	Missing police report
	•	Missing provider invoice
	•	Missing claimant signature

⸻

Killer Feature #2: Denial Risk Prediction

Extract denial signals:
	•	Wrong coding
	•	Out-of-network
	•	Missing prior auth

⸻

Killer Feature #3: Automated Routing

If claim > $25K → escalate
If injury severe → SIU
If missing docs → request automatically

⸻

✅ What You Should Do NEXT (Investor Sprint)

You have 2 weeks.

Here is the exact plan.

⸻

Week 1: Make Demo Bulletproof

Day 1–2: Stability
	•	Fix API base URL
	•	Fix login reliability
	•	Add /health check indicator in UI

Day 3: Upload Experience
	•	Upload should never crash browser
	•	OCR async job
	•	Show “Processing…” state

Day 4: Core Claim Extraction Fields

Add a default “Claim Schema”:
	•	claim_id
	•	claimant_name
	•	policy_number
	•	date_of_loss
	•	provider
	•	amount

Day 5: Review Workflow

Make it feel like Adjuster software:
	•	Approve
	•	Send back
	•	Flag fraud
	•	Export

⸻

Week 2: Investor Differentiation

Day 6–7: Claim Readiness Score

Simple scoring engine:
	•	Completeness %
	•	Missing docs list

Day 8: Export Integration Demo

Zapier webhook → Google Sheet

Investors LOVE that.

Day 9–10: Landing Page Rewrite

Focus on:
	•	Claims extraction
	•	Faster cycle time
	•	Reduced denials

⸻

✅ The Audit Checklist You Should Run Yourself

Since I can’t click-login, do this and paste results:

Pages
	•	Landing page clarity
	•	Login works?
	•	Upload works?
	•	Results Viewer works?
	•	Human Review works?
	•	Export CSV works?

Backend Logs

Run:

docker logs -f clarifyops-backend

During upload.

Browser Console

Any 500 errors?

⸻

✅ My Strongest Recommendation

ClarifyOps should be demoed as:

“AI Claims Intake → Structured Claim File → Ready for Adjuster Review”

Not:

“AI Document Platform with many features”

Narrow = fundable.

⸻

Next Step (Very Important)

If you want, I can give you an exact investor-grade audit if you paste just ONE of these:
	1.	Screenshot of landing hero + pricing
	2.	Console errors when uploading
	3.	Backend logs during claim upload
	4.	Output of these commands:

curl https://clarifyops.com/api/health
curl https://clarifyops.com/api/claims/login

Then I’ll tell you precisely what’s broken and what to ship before YC deadline.
