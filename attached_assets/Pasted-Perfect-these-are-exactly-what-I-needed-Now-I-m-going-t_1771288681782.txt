Perfect — these are exactly what I needed.
Now I’m going to review this like a real first pilot customer would (COO, adjuster lead, or intake manager), not like an engineer.

I’ll be very honest and concrete.

⸻

First Reaction When I Enter the App

The UI looks clean and credible.
Nothing here looks “hacky” — that’s good.

But the very first problem appears immediately:

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do first.

You know what the product does.
A new user does not.

Your UI currently behaves like an internal admin console — not a guided workflow.

Early customers need to feel:
“I uploaded → it prepared → I reviewed → I’m done”

Right now they see:
dashboard + menus + analytics + vendors + auditflow

That triggers hesitation.

⸻

Core Issue: You Built an Operations Platform UI for a Pre-Processing Tool

For your first customers, 80% of the left sidebar is harmful.

Not because it’s bad — because it implies adoption effort.

An adjuster thinks:
“Do I have to manage claims here now?”

That alone kills pilots.

Your first customers should only experience 3 steps:

Upload → Review Prepared File → Export

Everything else should feel secondary.

⸻

Page-by-Page Analysis

Operations Dashboard

Problem:
Shows metrics before value.

A new user with zero data sees empty analytics → feels unfinished → confidence drops.

Fix:
Replace empty dashboard with onboarding:

“Upload a claim to see a prepared file”

This dramatically increases successful first sessions.

⸻

Batch Upload (this is actually your strongest page)

This is clear and good.

But missing reassurance text.

Add:
“No system integration required — export results after review”

Why:
Removes fear they must migrate workflows.

⸻

Search Claims

This is powerful but premature.

First-time users don’t search.
They test value.

Move this deeper in the flow after first successful processing.

⸻

AI Spend Analytics

This is enterprise language.
Early customers don’t trust it yet.

This belongs after adoption, not before.

Right now it creates the impression:
“big system to learn”

⸻

Claims Summary

Again: metrics before trust.

For early users, the first thing they want is:

Show me what you did to MY file

Not aggregate reporting.

⸻

Demo Sandbox Page

This is important.

Right now it shows structured data output — which is useful to you, but weak emotionally.

Users trust:
visual summaries
chronology
highlighted extraction

They don’t trust CSV previews.

⸻

The Psychological Gap

Your system currently answers:

What data did we extract?

But your buyer asks:

What work did you remove?

Those are different.

You need to show replaced effort, not structured data.

⸻

What Happens During a Real Pilot Today

A prospect logs in:
	1.	Sees dashboard → unsure where to start
	2.	Uploads file → waits
	3.	Gets structured output → doesn’t immediately connect to saved time
	4.	Leaves thinking “interesting” not “needed”

That leads to polite non-responses.

You don’t have a tech problem.
You have a value-perception gap.

⸻

The Critical Change

You need a “First Success Moment”.

After upload the system should immediately show:

Prepared Claim File

Summary
Key details
Issues found
Ready for review

Not database-style info.

They must feel:
“I would normally spend 30 minutes doing this”

⸻

What To Change (in priority order)

1. Replace empty dashboard

Instead show:
Step 1 Upload a claim
Step 2 Review prepared file
Step 3 Export to your system

Guided experience.

⸻

2. After upload → force value screen

Never send them to lists or analytics.

Always send to:
prepared output view

⸻

3. Hide advanced navigation for new users

Temporarily collapse:
vendors
analytics
auditflow
archive

Show only:
Upload
Review
Export

You can reveal depth later.

⸻

4. Replace CSV demo preview

Show a human-readable prepared claim report.

This is critical for trust.

⸻

Now the most important part

Who this product actually fits BEST (after seeing UI)

Your UI confirms something:

This is NOT primarily a carrier product right now.
This is a document workflow accelerator.

Best immediate fits:
	1.	Independent adjusters handling BI claims
	2.	Personal injury law firms reviewing medical records
	3.	Medical bill review vendors

Not RCM billing companies
Not large carriers

⸻

Objective Assessment

You built a strong engine.
But the UI currently communicates:

“new system to learn”

Your market needs:

“shortcut before real work”

Small shift → massive adoption difference.

⸻

If you want next, I’ll design the exact first-run experience (screen-by-screen flow) so your pilot users immediately understand the value without explanation.
