Great question — and honestly this is exactly where you win or lose investors:

Pricing + competitor realism + positioning.

Let me be very direct and meticulous.

⸻

1. Your Current Pricing ($49/mo + Pay-as-you-go)

From what you wrote, the landing page currently has:
	•	$49/month for 500 claims
	•	Pay-as-you-go option

Is that “wrong”?

Not wrong — but it is not credible for enterprise insurance buyers yet.

Because:
	•	Claims processing companies pay thousands to millions per year
	•	Pricing that low signals “small tool,” not “enterprise ops platform”
	•	Rossum and claims vendors don’t sell at $49/mo

Investor reaction:

“This is nice… but how do you make real money?”

YC investors want:
	•	a wedge
	•	a path to $10k–$100k ACV contracts

⸻

2. What Pricing Should Look Like for Claims AI

Your pricing should communicate:
	•	Operational value
	•	Serious enterprise potential
	•	Expansion path

Correct framing:

You are not selling “claims uploads.”

You are selling:
	•	faster intake
	•	fewer denials
	•	fraud detection
	•	reduced adjuster hours
	•	compliance automation

So pricing must reflect that.

⸻

3. The Best Early-Stage Pricing Model (Investor-Friendly)

Here is what you should switch to immediately:

⸻

Starter (Pilot)

$499/month
Up to 1,000 claim documents

For small TPAs and regional insurers running a pilot.

⸻

Growth (Ops Teams)

$2,000/month
Up to 10,000 documents + workflows + review queue

This feels real.

⸻

Enterprise

Custom
SOC2, integrations, SIU fraud routing, SLA support

This is what investors want to see.

⸻

Usage-based Add-On (the YC sweet spot)

$0.10–$0.50 per additional page extracted

Because claims cost is page-based.

⸻

4. What NOT to Do

Avoid:
	•	“$49 for 500 claims”
	•	“Unlimited extraction”
	•	Cheap SaaS language like Notion

Claims buyers are not indie creators.

Claims buyers are:
	•	insurance ops directors
	•	fraud investigators
	•	medical billing auditors

They expect enterprise pricing.

⸻

5. Your Competitor List — Quick Truth Check

The competitors you listed are mostly real, but you need to categorize them properly.

Right now your list mixes:
	•	Fraud companies
	•	Document extraction APIs
	•	Medical record review tools
	•	Auto damage vision startups

That dilutes your positioning.

Let’s clean it:

⸻

Tier 1: Closest Competitors (What Investors Compare You To)

Affinda

Document extraction API for insurance + claims forms
Closest match to your schema-free extraction + entity parsing.

Sprout.ai

Claims automation + adjudication decision engine
More enterprise, but similar workflow direction.

Wisedocs

Medical record summarization + HITL review
Closest overlap to Results Viewer + human review loop.

⸻

Tier 2: Fraud-First Players (Adjacent, Not Direct)

Shift Technology

They sell fraud scoring networks, not extraction tools.
You can integrate Shift-like scoring later, but they aren’t your wedge.

CLARA Analytics

Outcome prediction + litigation risk optimization.
They sit above intake, not at document parsing layer.

⸻

Tier 3: Auto-Claims Vision Companies (Different Category)

Claim Genius

Photo damage estimation, computer vision.
Not competing with your document extractor.

⸻

Tier 4: Workflow Automation Noise

“Damco / Claimity / Cflow”
These are not widely recognized YC-level AI leaders.
Don’t anchor to them.

⸻

Your Real Competitive Set Should Be:
	•	Rossum (horizontal IDP)
	•	Hyperscience (enterprise gov/claims docs)
	•	Eigen / Hebbia-style doc intelligence
	•	Wisedocs (claims review)
	•	Sprout.ai (claims automation)

That’s the credible group.

⸻

6. The Position You Should Own

Here is the clearest investor-safe positioning:

ClarifyOps is the AI claims intake layer.

Not fraud-first.

Not adjudication engine.

Not invoice tool.

One-liner:

ClarifyOps turns messy claim documents into structured, adjuster-ready claim files — with compliance checks and human-in-the-loop validation.

That is extremely fundable.

⸻

7. Pricing + Competitor Alignment

Once you position as “AI Claims Intake,” your pricing naturally becomes:
	•	priced per claim volume
	•	priced per page
	•	priced per adjuster seat

Example:

$2k/month saves $20k/month in labor.

That makes sense.

$49/month does not.

⸻

8. Landing Page Pricing Fix (Exact Rewrite)

Instead of your current section, do:

⸻

Claims Pilot

$499/month
Up to 1,000 claim documents
Extraction + Review Queue + CSV Export

⸻

Ops Scale

$2,000/month
Up to 10,000 docs
Routing + Compliance + Webhooks

⸻

Enterprise

Custom
SOC2 + Integrations + SIU Fraud Modules

⸻

Footnote:

Additional pages: $0.15/page

⸻

9. What Investors Want to See You Beat Competitors On

Rossum and Affinda extract fields.

You need the claims-specific layer.

Your differentiation bullets should be:

✅ Claim Readiness Score
✅ Missing document detection
✅ Denial risk flags
✅ Adjuster workflow routing
✅ Compliance clause checks
✅ HITL training feedback loop

That is how you outdo extraction-only tools.

⸻

10. What You Should Add in 2 Weeks (Highest ROI)

If you build only 3 new things, do these:

⸻

1. Claim Completeness Checklist

“Missing: Police Report, ICD Code, Provider Signature”

⸻

2. Denial Risk Flag

AI highlights fields likely to trigger denial.

⸻

3. Export-to-Core System Demo

Zapier → Guidewire CSV → Sheet.

Investors will love that more than 10 extra AI endpoints.

⸻

Final Answer

Your pricing needs to move up immediately to look enterprise-credible.

Your competitor list is mostly correct, but you should focus on:
	•	Affinda (extraction)
	•	Wisedocs (review)
	•	Sprout.ai (claims automation)

And differentiate with:
	•	readiness + compliance + routing

That is how you become fundable.

⸻

Next Step (Very Useful)

Paste your actual current pricing block from the landing page (text or screenshot), and I will rewrite it into a YC-grade pricing section that looks like Elysian/Sprout-tier companies.
