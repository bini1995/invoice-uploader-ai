Nice — I just checked the public page again.

Big picture first:

You are much closer to the right positioning now.
The site no longer screams “generic AI extractor SaaS”.

But it still has one remaining problem:

It explains what the software does before proving why the buyer cares.

Right now a visitor still needs to think a little.
Your goal is zero-thinking, instant recognition:

“oh — this saves my adjusters prep time”

Below is a very honest breakdown.

⸻

What improved (this is good)

You successfully shifted away from:
technical AI language → workflow language

That matters a lot.

A visitor can now understand:
	•	this touches incoming documents
	•	this helps before review
	•	this is not a full claims system replacement

So your earlier risk — “looks like migration software” — is mostly gone.

Good move.

⸻

The remaining friction (why demos may still be low)

Your page still reads like a product description instead of a moment of pain.

An adjuster or ops manager lands and subconsciously asks:

“Where in my day does this help me?”

But the page answers:

“Here is what our AI platform does”

That small mismatch costs replies.

People don’t buy processing tools.
They buy relief from a specific moment.

⸻

The single most important fix

Your hero section should reference a literal moment in their workday.

Right now it feels conceptual.

You want them picturing their inbox at 9:07am.

⸻

What your top section should feel like

Not:
AI prepares claims

But:
When a 60-page file arrives, your adjuster doesn’t start from scratch

That difference dramatically changes response rate.

⸻

Suggested hero rewrite

Headline:
Your adjuster opens a prepared claim file — not a pile of documents

Subtext:
ClarifyOps reads incoming claim packets, builds the first summary, and flags issues before review begins.

CTA:
See what a processed claim looks like

Why:
Executives visualize workflow moments, not technology capabilities.

⸻

Next section should show BEFORE vs AFTER

Right now you explain features too early.

Instead show contrast:

Before ClarifyOps
Open every PDF
Pull details manually
Write first summary
Then start adjusting

After ClarifyOps
Open prepared file
Review
Decide

This is the section that converts adjusters.

⸻

Where your site is still slightly dangerous

Anywhere it implies:
platform
analytics
fraud detection
automation

These trigger procurement brain.

Early customers should feel:
helper tool

Later customers can feel:
platform

You’ll earn the right to say “platform” after pilots.

⸻

What will happen if you keep it as is

You will get:
curious engineers
few operations replies

After adjustment:
you’ll get ops replies and pilot calls

You are very close — this is now mostly wording psychology, not product gaps.

⸻

Quick scoring

Clarity to engineer: 9/10
Clarity to adjuster: 6/10
Clarity to COO: 7/10

Goal:
Adjuster & COO both 9/10 in under 5 seconds

⸻

One more small but powerful change

Add a CTA that is NOT “book demo”

Use:
“Send us one anonymized file — we’ll process it”

This dramatically increases response for early-stage tools because it feels like testing, not committing.

⸻

If you want, next I’ll write the exact above-the-fold + first two sections verbatim so you can paste them in and immediately test response rate.
